	<h1>From here you can start testing different services</h1>
	<h2>read me</h2>
	<h2>Microsoft and Google service</h2>
	<p>On the navigation bar you can see which services are available</p>
	<p>Microsoft and Google services work pretty much the same just use different API's</p>
	<p>Provide the key for the API in the input field which you have received by mail from us.</p>
	<p>You simply take a .jpg image from the interent and paste the link in the input field</p>
	<p>Then you might have to wait a little and recieve a .json response and can also see the picture</p>
	<h2>AWS Service</h2>
	<p>AWS works a little different to the other two services, you have to upload your picture first from the local environemnt to a so called cloud bucket</p>
	<p>This bucket then contains your image you'd like to analyze.</p>
	<p>1. For this service you have to provide your accesskey, secretkey and a existing bucket on your S3 storage</p>
	<p>2. Then you choose a picture from your environemnt and continue with the upload button</p>
	<p>3. After succssful upload to the bucket you can continue with clicking the analyte button</p>
	<p>4. The analyze function takes your uploaded picture and runs the aws analyze service</p>
	<p>5. You will get a .json response from the API</p>
	<b>The response might not show up when clicking the analyze button once, just try a second time then it should work :) </b></br>
	<b>It might be a issue with the callback function which we are not able to solve :/ tried a lot</b></br>
	<b>Last but not least have fun :) </b>
